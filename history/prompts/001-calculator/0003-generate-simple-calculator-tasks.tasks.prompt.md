## Prompt

1. Recieve input 2. Validate expression  3. Evaluate safety 4. Return result

## Response snapshot

I have created the `tasks.md` file based on the feature specification and implementation plan. It includes a total of 26 tasks, with 12 tasks specifically for User Story 1. Parallel opportunities have been identified, particularly for implementing arithmetic functions and writing unit tests. User Story 1 (Perform Basic Calculation) is suggested as the MVP scope.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Detailed task list generated for Simple Calculator feature.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: specs/001-calculator/tasks.md created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with implementation based on tasks.md.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated a comprehensive task list following the specified format and guidelines.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A

## Prompt

Plan: take expression -> validate -> evaluate -> return number

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan for the Simple Calculator, including the technical context, constitution check, and project structure. I encountered an issue where I could not directly edit the `plan.md` file using the `Edit` tool and asked the user to manually update it.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Simple Calculator implementation plan outlined.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: plan.md outlined.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with plan (research.md, data-model.md, contracts, quickstart.md)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully outlined the implementation plan, but encountered a tool issue when updating the plan file.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `Edit` tool reporting unexpected file modification.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate `Edit` tool behavior or use `Write` tool directly if `Edit` continues to fail.
